I currently serve on my school district's Community Education Council. Although these boards are completely voluntary, council members do work closely with the superintendent and the Chancellor. In my role, I've been able to influence decisions made in our district and help school communities get the aid they need. We also make decisions on school zoning lines as well, so it is very important for parents to get involved and vote for people that will put the best interests for the district and it's children first. Especially as we have some members that are elected with less than 100 votes that want to maintain the system of "haves" and "have nots" in our public schools. I wanted to use this map to show people how many votes were cast in the 2021 elections and encourage them to vote.
