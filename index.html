                    Click each district to see the number of votes cast there.
                </p>
                <p>Community Education Councils or CECs are charged with promoting student achievement, advising and
                    commenting on educational policies, and providing input to the Chancellor and the Panel for
                    Education Policy (PEP).</p>
                <p>Each school district has their own CEC with 11 members. 9 of the 11 members are elected by parents
                    and guardians with children in the school district and the other 2 members are appointed by their
                    respective Borough President.
                </p>
                <p>Every parent or guardian is provided 3 votes per child in grades K - 8 in each school district.</p>
                <p>Currently, the participation level has been low in comparison to the amount of students in each
                    district.
                </p>
                <p>Make sure you have a voice this elections cycle.
